# Customization Guide - Adapting the App for Different Businesses

This guide explains how to customize the Shanuzz Academy LMS v9 for other businesses (Salon, Coaching, Real Estate, etc.). The app architecture remains the same—only configuration and branding change.

**Latest Version**: v9.2 includes location/source field fixes, DD/MM/YYYY date standardization, activity logging on assignment, improved follow-up date logic, performance optimization for syntaxfoolcard.html, and verified dual task filtering.

## Phase 1: Create New Google Sheet Infrastructure

### Step 1: Create a Fresh Google Sheet for Your Business

1. Go to **Google Sheets** (sheets.google.com)

### Step 2: Create the 7 Required Tabs (Sheet Tabs)

At the bottom of the sheet, you'll see "Sheet1". We need to create 7 tabs with exact names:

2. `Activities`
3. `Tasks`
4. `Users`
5. `Logs`
6. `Interests`

## Phase 3: Deploy Backend (Same Code, Different Sheet)

### Step 1: Open Google Apps Script Editor

1. In your **new Google Sheet**, click **Extensions** → **Apps Script**
2. Delete any existing code
3. Paste the entire `code.gs` code (from your academy version)
4. **No code changes needed** - it works for any business!

### Step 2: Deploy as Web App

1. Click **Deploy** → **New Deployment**
2. Configuration:
   - Type: **Web App**
   - Description: **"Shanuzz Salon LMS API"** (update name)
   - Execute as: **Me**
   - Who has access: **Anyone**
3. Click **Deploy**
4. **Copy the Web App URL** (ends in `/exec`)

---

## Phase 4: Configure Frontend (index.html)

The frontend code remains **100% the same**. But you need to update:

### Option A: Change Business Name in UI (Simple)

Find and replace these text strings in `index.html`:

#### 1. Change App Title
```javascript
// Find this line (around line 160):
<h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800" id="loginTitle">LeadFlow</h1>

// Change to:
<h1 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800" id="loginTitle">Shanuzz Salon</h1>
```

#### 2. Change App Name in Settings/Header
Find lines with "Shanuzz Academy" and replace with your business name.

#### 3. Update Field Names (Optional, for clarity)

Search for these and replace if needed:

| Current (Academy) | New (Salon) | Search in index.html |
|------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| "interest" | "service" | Search "Interest" and change labels |
| "value" | "price" | Search "Value" and change labels |
| "lostReason" | "cancelledReason" | Search "lostReason" and change labels |

**Example change**:
```javascript
// Before:
<label>Interest</label>
<select name="interest">...</select>

// After:
<label>Service</label>
<select name="service">...</select>
```

### Option B: Change Branding Colors

Find these color codes and replace with your brand colors:

```javascript
// Primary color (blue)
'primary: #4f46e5'  → Change to your brand color hex

// Find and replace:
text-blue-600 → text-[your-color]-600
bg-blue-600 → bg-[your-color]-600
```

---

## Phase 5: Connect Frontend to New Backend

### Step 1: Open index.html in Browser

1. Double-click `index.html` to open in browser
2. You'll see the login screen

### Step 2: Configure Web App URL

1. Login with **any credentials** (or create superuser on first login)
2. Click **Menu (≡)** → **Settings > SYS Config**
3. Paste your **new Google Apps Script Web App URL** into the field
4. Click **Save & Sync**
5. Wait for data to load

**Done!** Your app is now connected to the new Google Sheet.

## Advanced: Custom Fields for Your Business

If you need additional fields beyond the standard ones, you can add them to the Leads sheet.

### Example: Add "Budget" field for Real Estate

**Step 1**: Add column in Google Sheet
```
Column M: "budget" (in Leads sheet header)
```

**Step 2**: Update backend (`code.gs`)
```javascript
// Find this line in doPost function:
const headers = ['id', 'name', 'phone', 'email', 'status', 'value', 'source', 'interest', 'assignedTo', 'lostReason', 'createdAt', 'updatedAt'];

// Change to:
const headers = ['id', 'name', 'phone', 'email', 'status', 'value', 'source', 'interest', 'assignedTo', 'lostReason', 'budget', 'createdAt', 'updatedAt'];
```

**Step 3**: Update frontend (`index.html`)
```javascript
// Find the form in Lead Modal and add:
<div>
  <label class="text-xs font-semibold">Budget</label>
  <input type="number" name="budget" placeholder="Enter budget">
</div>

// Update renderTable() to display budget column:
<td>${lead.budget || '-'}</td>
```

**Redeploy** and test.

## Important Notes

### Database Independence
- Each Google Sheet is **completely independent**
- Changing one doesn't affect the others
- You can run multiple instances simultaneously

### Code Reusability
- The same `index.html` and `code.gs` work for **any business**
- No need to maintain multiple versions
- Updates to logic apply to all instances automatically

### Data Migration (Copying an Existing Instance)
If you want to copy an existing instance:

1. Open existing Google Sheet
2. **File** → **Make a copy**
3. Rename the copy (e.g., "Salon LMS")
4. Update data in Interests/Settings/Users tabs
5. Deploy new Apps Script
6. Update Web App URL in frontend

---

## Troubleshooting Customization

### Issue: "Dropdowns are empty"
- **Solution**: Verify data exists in Interests and Settings tabs
- Click refresh icon in header to force sync

### Issue: "New field not showing in table"
- **Solution**: Make sure you added column to Google Sheet AND updated code.gs headers array
- Redeploy Apps Script

### Issue: "Cannot save data"
- **Solution**: Verify Google Sheet is shared with "Editor" access
- Check that column headers match exactly (case-sensitive)

### Issue: "Web App URL not connecting"
- **Solution**: Ensure deployment is set to "Anyone" access
- Copy URL exactly from deployment URL (not the script page URL)

---

## Summary: Core Principle

**The app is architecture-agnostic.** It works for ANY business because:

1. **Frontend** - Generic lead management UI (name, phone, email, status, value, source, interest, assigned-to)
2. **Backend** - Generic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
3. **Database** - Standardized 7-tab structure

Only **business-specific values** change (Interests, Locations, Sources, user names, field labels).

---

## Next Steps

1. Create new Google Sheet for your business
2. Set up the 7 tabs with business-specific data
3. Deploy Apps Script from existing code.gs
4. Configure frontend with new Web App URL
5. Test with your team
6. Go live!

For detailed code documentation, see `DEVELOPER.md`.
For user guide, see `summary.md`.
